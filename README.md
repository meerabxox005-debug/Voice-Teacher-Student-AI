# Voice-Based Teacher–Student AI

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a voice-based Teacher–Student AI system built using Python and OpenRouter API.
The student asks questions using voice input, and the AI responds like a teacher using a female voice.

## 🎯 Objective
- Voice-based learning system
- Hands-free interaction
- Demonstrate core Python concepts

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenRouter API
- SpeechRecognition
- pyttsx3
- Requests

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Student speaks a question
2. Voice is converted to text
3. Text is sent to OpenRouter AI
4. AI generates teacher response
5. Response is spoken in female voice
6. Loop continues until student says "exit"

## 📚 Python Concepts Used
- Loops
- Conditional statements
- Functions
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Input & Output
